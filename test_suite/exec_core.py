        1. structural assumptions -> test model file entrypoint and process update (1) manually. Assert expected outputs
            from processes (as seen in examples omex dirs).

        2. data assumptions -> test model config entrypoint with custom params like species, params, reactions, etc. HERE is
            where the comparison matrices should be analyzed. Also, implement "stress test".

        3. is it publishable? -> is the omex properly formatted with process output?
