## Compositional Schemas and Milner Bigraphs

Compositional Bigraph Schemas (CBS) are based on a mathematical formalism introduced by 
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+space+and+motion+of+communicating+agents+by+robin+milner" target="_blank">Robin Milner in 2009</a>
, and used in Vivarium. 
Bigraphs consist of networks with embeddable nodes that can be placed *within* other nodes and dynamically restructured.
CBS reimagines the bigraph concept. Variables are contained within Stores (the circles in the figure), which can be embedded
in a hierarchy, as shown by the dark edges. Instead of Milner's hyperedges, CBS employs Processes (the rectangles) which 
connect via wires (dashed edges) to shared variables within the Stores. Processes and Stores form a type of bipartite graph, 
as illustrated by the dashed edges.

In Vivarium, the CBS is used to structure a modular multiscale simulation. Bigraph-viz is part of an effort to
standardize this structure, so that it can be used as an exchange format for multiscale simulations.

## Getting Started


### Dependencies

Before installing `bigraph-viz`, make sure you have [Graphviz](https://pypi.org/project/graphviz/).

#### Ubuntu/Debian

```console
sudo apt-get install -y graphviz
```
#### macOS

```console
brew install graphviz
```

#### Windows
Download and install the Graphviz installer from the [official website](https://graphviz.org/download/). 
Make sure to add the Graphviz bin directory to your system's PATH.

### Installation

Once Graphviz is installed, you can install `bigraph-viz` using pip:

```console
pip install bigraph-viz
```
